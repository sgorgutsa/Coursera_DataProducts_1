```

This is a simple demo of how a custom map can be added into R markdown document using Leaflet library. In this case we will add a map showing Physics Department of the Moscow State Univrsity.

```{r}
# Loading leaflet library
library(leaflet)

# Creating custom logo for marker
MSU_PD_icon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://www.phys.msu.ru/rus/gallery/symbolics/img/sign-physfak-historical.jpg",
  iconWidth =40, iconHeight = 40)
# Create map
MSU_PD <- leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(lat=55.70024546484674, lng=37.52942597040042, popup = "Department of Physics, Moscow State University", icon = MSU_PD_icon )

MSU_PD
```
